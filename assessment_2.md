**24/12/20** 

This is the first Gantt chart we produced, after the project details
having been released. It was quite abstracted as our first sprint
consisted of getting to grips with understanding the specifications
of the new project, especially in terms of the documentation and code
of Team 14, the team whose work we have taken on board.

**07/01/21** 

Due to the holiday and exam season we unfortunately unable to make
much progress for the last fortnight. However this sprint we managed
to make progress on the documentation side of things by working on
outlining the methods we had in place to deal with changing
environments and requirements. We also began researching both testing
and Continuous Integration methods. We also added a Continuous
Integration infrastructure to our GitHub project, as detailed in the
Continuous Integration document.

**14/01/21**

This sprint we made much progress in terms of the Change Report. We
changed Team 14's old documentation, as well as justifying these
changes. We still have to add the Concrete Architecture as of yet,
however. The programming team had made a headway in changing the code
quality and making it consistent.

**21/01/21**

On the programming side of things, we were able to implement powerups
and difficulty levels, however the save game implementation was taking
a lot longer than expected. Commented on the CI infrastructure we set
up. They still need to work on the commenting and JavaDocs adding. The
documentation team needs to add all the necessary documents to the
website cloned from Team 14.



**28/01/2021**
Completed the requirements on the product. Generated concrete
architecture. Worked on testing methods.  Need to write these up in
the Testing document.



**04/02/2021**
Completed testing methods and finishing up testing evaluation.


**09/02/2021**
Final checks on everything and made sure every deliverable and
executable was linked to on the website.
