You first will be able to chose your boat from a roster of six different boats all with different statistics.

You will race other computer controlled boats throughout the three legs with increasing difficulty each round.

At the end of the first three legs your total time will be compared to all  other boats and if you have been fast enough you will enter the final.

Once in the final you can compete to be in the top three to win yourself a medal.

A variety of obstacles will stand in your path including: Ducks, Rocks, Logs and Rubbish and you will have to try to avoid them all as not to have your boat lose all of its health.
